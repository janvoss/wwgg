	abstract = {This paper draws a distinction between ‘communitarian’ and ‘rationalist’ legal orders on the basis of the implied political strategy. We argue that the West’s solution to the paradox of governance – that a government strong enough to protect rights cannot itself be restrained from violating those rights – originates in certain aspects of the feudal contract, a confluence of aspects of communitarian Germanic law, which enshrined a contractual notion of political authority, and rationalistic Roman law, which supported large-scale political organization. We trace the tradition of strong but limited government to the conflict between factions with an interest in these legal traditions – nobles and the crown, respectively – and draw limited conclusions for legal development in non-Western contexts.},

Using the number of steam engines installed by 1800 as a synthetic indicator of technological change and occupational statistics to measure working skills (using {HISCLASS}), we establish a positive correlation between the use of steam engines and the share of skilled workers at the county level. We use exogenous variation in carboniferous rock strata (containing coal to fuel the engines) to show that the effect was causal. While technological change stimulated the formation of working skills, it had an overall negative effect on the formation of primary education, captured by literacy and school enrolment rates. It also led to higher gender inequality in literacy.},

	abstract = {While human capital is a strong predictor of economic development today, its importance for the Industrial Revolution has typically been assessed as minor. To resolve this puzzling contrast, we differentiate average human capital (literacy) from upper-tail knowledge. As a proxy for the historical presence of knowledge elites, we use city-level subscriptions to the famous Encyclopedie in mid-18th century France. We show that subscriber density is a strong predictor of city growth after the onset of French industrialization. Alternative measures of development such as soldier height, disposable income, and industrial activity confirm this pattern. Initial literacy levels, on the other hand, are associated with development in the cross-section, but they do not predict growth. Finally, by joining data on British patents with a large French firm survey from the 1840s, we shed light on the mechanism: upper-tail knowledge raised productivity in innovative industrial technology.},

In the face of the Ukraine crisis, for instance, the {EU} marshaled a surprisingly strong sanctions regime, but could not prevent Member States from pursuing divergent pro-Russia policies, such as signing new energy deals or granting port access for Russian naval forces.

	abstract = {Human populations underwent range contractions during the Last Glacial Maximum ({LGM}) which had lasting and dramatic effects on their genetic variation. The genetic ancestry of individuals associated with the post-{LGM} Magdalenian technocomplex has been interpreted as being derived from groups associated with the pre-{LGM} Aurignacian. However, both these ancestries differ from that of central European individuals associated with the chronologically intermediate Gravettian. Thus, the genomic transition from pre- to post-{LGM} remains unclear also in western Europe, where we lack genomic data associated with the intermediate Solutrean, which spans the height of the {LGM}. Here we present genome-wide data from sites in Andalusia in southern Spain, including from a Solutrean-associated individual from Cueva del Malalmuerzo, directly dated to {\textasciitilde}23,000 cal yr bp. The Malalmuerzo individual carried genetic ancestry that directly connects earlier Aurignacian-associated individuals with post-{LGM} Magdalenian-associated ancestry in western Europe. This scenario differs from Italy, where individuals associated with the transition from pre- and post-{LGM} carry different genetic ancestries. This suggests different dynamics in the proposed southern refugia of Ice Age Europe and posits Iberia as a potential refugium for western European pre-{LGM} ancestry. More, individuals from Cueva Ardales, which were thought to be of Palaeolithic origin, date younger than expected and, together with individuals from the Andalusian sites Caserones and Aguilillas, fall within the genetic variation of the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age individuals from southern Iberia.},

	abstract = {Modern humans have populated Europe for more than 45,000 years1,2. Our knowledge of the genetic relatedness and structure of ancient hunter-gatherers is however limited, owing to the scarceness and poor molecular preservation of human remains from that period3. Here we analyse 356 ancient hunter-gatherer genomes, including new genomic data for 116 individuals from 14 countries in western and central Eurasia, spanning between 35,000 and 5,000 years ago. We identify a genetic ancestry profile in individuals associated with Upper Palaeolithic Gravettian assemblages from western Europe that is distinct from contemporaneous groups related to this archaeological culture in central and southern Europe4, but resembles that of preceding individuals associated with the Aurignacian culture. This ancestry profile survived during the Last Glacial Maximum (25,000 to 19,000 years ago) in human populations from southwestern Europe associated with the Solutrean culture, and with the following Magdalenian culture that re-expanded northeastward after the Last Glacial Maximum. Conversely, we reveal a genetic turnover in southern Europe suggesting a local replacement of human groups around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, accompanied by a north-to-south dispersal of populations associated with the Epigravettian culture. From at least 14,000 years ago, an ancestry related to this culture spread from the south across the rest of Europe, largely replacing the Magdalenian-associated gene pool. After a period of limited admixture that spanned the beginning of the Mesolithic, we find genetic interactions between western and eastern European hunter-gatherers, who were also characterized by marked differences in phenotypically relevant variants.},

Gleichzeitig werden die Folgen von Globalisierung auf globale Gerechtigkeit durchaus kritisch bewertet. Perspektiven auf die Global Governance sind dabei eng mit den unterschiedlichen Interpretationen über die Folgen der Globalisierung verbunden und konzeptionalisieren entsprechend auch die Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten der durch Globalisierungsprozesse hervorgerufenen Interdependenzen und Folgephänomene sehr unterschiedlich. Ziel dieses Beitrags ist es zunächst zentrale konzeptionelle Zugriffe von Globalisierung darzustellen und ihre treibenden Kräfte und Ursachen zu beleuchten. In einem zweiten Schritt wird dann das Konzept von Global Governance erörtert, dessen politischer und wissenschaftlicher Kontext dargelegt und Kontroversen über mögliche Auslegungen verdeutlicht. Die zentralen Akteure transnationale Unternehmen, Staaten, globale Zivilgesellschaft und internationale Regierungsorganisationen werden hinsichtlich ihrer unterschiedlichen Kapazitäten und Legitimität innerhalb des Global Governance Gefüges diskutiert. Es wird gezeigt, dass Globalisierung und Global Governance hinsichtlich ihrer Gestaltbarkeit und Auswirkungen unterschiedlich bewertet werden, sowie die aus den ihnen zugrunde liegenden Ideen resultierende Kritik spezifiziert.},
